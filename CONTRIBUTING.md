## TLDR;

1. Create your own fork of the repo
2. Make changes to the code in your fork
3. Run unit tests and integration tests
4. Check the code with linters
5. Submit PR from your fork to main branch of the project repo


## Prerequisites

- git
- Python 3.12 or 3.13
- pip

The development requires at least [Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html) due to significant improvement on performance, optimizations which benefit modern ML, AI, LLM, NL stacks, and improved asynchronous processing capabilities. It is also possible to use Python 3.13.



### Tooling installation

1. `pip install --user uv`
1. `uv --version` -- should return no error



## Setting up your development environment

```bash
# clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GIT-PROFILE/lightspeed-stack.git

# move into the directory
cd lightspeed-stack

# setup your devel environment with uv
uv install -G dev

# Now you can run test commands trough make targets, or prefix the rest of commands with `uv run`, eg. `uv run make test`

# run unit tests
make unit-tests

# run integration tests
make integration-tests

# code formatting
# (this is also run automatically as part of pre-commit hook if configured)
make format

# code style and docstring style
# (this is also run automatically as part of pre-commit hook if configured)
make verify

# check type hints
# (this is also run automatically as part of pre-commit hook)
make check-types
```

Happy hacking!


## Definition of Done

### A deliverable is to be considered “done” when

* Code is complete, commented, and merged to the relevant release branch
* User facing documentation written (where relevant)
* Acceptance criteria in the related Jira ticket (where applicable) are verified and fulfilled
* Pull request title+commit includes Jira number
* Changes are covered by unit tests that run cleanly in the CI environment (where relevant)
* Changes are covered by integration tests that run cleanly in the CI environment (where relevant)
* Changes are covered by E2E tests that run cleanly in the CI environment (where relevant)
* All linters are running cleanly in the CI environment
* Code changes reviewed by at least one peer
* Code changes acked by at least one project owner

## Automation

### Pre-commit hook settings

It is possible to run formatters and linters automatically for all commits. You just need
to copy file `hooks/pre-commit` into subdirectory `.git/hooks/`. It must be done manually
because the copied file is an executable script (so from GIT point of view it is unsafe
to enable it automatically).


### Code coverage measurement

During testing, code coverage is measured. If the coverage is below defined threshold (see `pyproject.toml` settings for actual value stored in section `[tool.coverage.report]`), tests will fail. We measured and checked code coverage in order to be able to develop software with high quality.

Code coverage reports are generated in JSON and also in format compatible with [_JUnit_ test automation framework](https://junit.org/junit5/). It is also possible to start `make coverage-report` to generate code coverage reports in the form of interactive HTML pages. These pages are stored in the `htmlcov` subdirectory. Just open the index page from this subdirectory in your web browser.

### Type hints checks

It is possible to check if type hints added into the code are correct and whether assignments, function calls etc. use values of the right type. This check is invoked by following command:

```
make check-types
```

Please note that type hints check might be very slow on the first run.
Subsequent runs are much faster thanks to the cache that Mypy uses. This check
is part of a CI job that verifies sources.


### Linters

_Black_, _Ruff_, Pyright, and _Pylint_ tools are used as linters. There are a bunch of linter rules enabled for this repository. All of them are specified in `pyproject.toml`, such us in sections `[tool.ruff]` and `[tool.pylint."MESSAGES CONTROL"]`. Some specific rules can be disabled using `ignore` parameter (empty now).

List of all _Ruff_ rules recognized by Ruff can be retrieved by:


```
ruff linter
```

Description of all _Ruff_ rules are available on https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/

Ruff rules can be disabled in source code (for given line or block) by using special `noqa` comment line. For example:

```python
# noqa: E501
```

List of all _Pylint_ rules can be retrieved by:

```
pylint --list-msgs
```

Description of all rules are available on https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/checkers/features.html

To disable _Pylint_ rule in source code, the comment line in following format can be used:

```python
# pylint: disable=C0415
```



### Security checks

Static security check is performed by _Bandit_ tool. The check can be started by using:

```
make security-check
```



## Code style

### Docstrings style
We are using [Google's docstring style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

Here is simple example:
```python
def function_with_pep484_type_annotations(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
    """Example function with PEP 484 type annotations.
    
    Args:
        param1: The first parameter.
        param2: The second parameter.
    
    Returns:
        The return value. True for success, False otherwise.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the first parameter does not contain proper model name
    """
```

For further guidance, see the rest of our codebase, or check sources online. There are many, eg. [this one](https://gist.github.com/redlotus/3bc387c2591e3e908c9b63b97b11d24e).
