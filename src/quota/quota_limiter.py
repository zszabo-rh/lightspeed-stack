"""Abstract class that is the parent for all quota limiter implementations.

It is possible to limit quota usage per user or per service or services (that
typically run in one cluster). Each limit is configured as a separate _quota
limiter_. It can be of type `user_limiter` or `cluster_limiter` (which is name
that makes sense in OpenShift deployment). There are three configuration
options for each limiter:

1. `period` specified in a human-readable form, see
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-INTERVAL-INPUT
for all possible options. When the end of the period is reached, quota is reset
or increased
1. `initial_quota` is set at beginning of the period
1. `quota_increase` this value (if specified) is used to increase quota when period is reached

There are two basic use cases:

1. When quota needs to be reset specific value periodically (for example on
weekly on monthly basis), specify `initial_quota` to the required value
1. When quota needs to be increased by specific value periodically (for example
on daily basis), specify `quota_increase`

Technically it is possible to specify both `initial_quota` and
`quota_increase`. It means that at the end of time period the quota will be
*reset* to `initial_quota + quota_increase`.

Please note that any number of quota limiters can be configured. For example,
two user quota limiters can be set to:
- increase quota by 100,000 tokens each day
- reset quota to 10,000,000 tokens each month
