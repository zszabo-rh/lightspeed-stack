Feature: streaming_query endpoint API tests

  Background:
    Given The service is started locally
      And REST API service prefix is /v1


  Scenario: Check if streaming_query response in tokens matches the full response
    Given The system is in default state
    And I use "streaming_query" to ask question
    """
    {"query": "Generate sample yaml file for simple GitHub Actions workflow."}

     When I wait for the response to be completed
     Then The status code of the response is 200
      And The streamed response is equal to the full response

  Scenario: Check if LLM responds properly to restrictive system prompt to sent question with different system prompt
    Given The system is in default state

          | questions                 |
