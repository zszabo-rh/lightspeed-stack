# Architecture

Overall architecture with all main parts is displayed below:

![Architecture diagram](docs/architecture.png)

Lightspeed Core Stack is based on the FastAPI framework (Uvicorn). The service is split into several parts described below.

# Prerequisites

* Python 3.12, or 3.13
    - please note that currently Python 3.14 is not officially supported
    - all sources are made (backward) compatible with Python 3.12; it is checked on CI

# Installation

Installation steps depends on operation system. Please look at instructions for your system:


- [Linux installation](https://lightspeed-core.github.io/lightspeed-stack/installation_linux)
- [macOS installation](https://lightspeed-core.github.io/lightspeed-stack/installation_macos)

# Run LCS locally

To quickly get hands on LCS, we can run it using the default configurations provided in this repository: 
0. install dependencies using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) `uv sync --group dev --group llslibdev`
1. check Llama stack settings in [run.yaml](run.yaml), make sure we can access the provider and the model, the server shoud listen to port 8321.
2. export the LLM token env var that Llama stack requires. for OpenAI, we set the env var by `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx`
3. start Llama stack server `uv run llama stack run run.yaml`
4. check the LCS settings in [lightspeed-stack.yaml](lightspeed-stack.yaml). `llama_stack.url` should be `url: http://localhost:8321`
5. start LCS server `make run`
6. access LCS web UI at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)


# Configuration

## LLM Compatibility

Lightspeed Core Stack (LCS) supports the large language models from the providers listed below. 

| Provider | Model                                          | Tool Calling | provider_type  | Example                                                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI   | gpt-5, gpt-4o, gpt4-turbo, gpt-4.1, o1, o3, o4 | Yes          | remote::openai | [1](examples/openai-faiss-run.yaml) [2](examples/openai-pgvector-run.yaml) |
| OpenAI   | gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4                           | No           | remote::openai |                                                                            |
| RHAIIS (vLLM)| meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct           | Yes          | remote::vllm   | [1](tests/e2e/configs/run-rhaiis.yaml)                                     |

The "provider_type" is used in the llama stack configuration file when refering to the provider.

For details of OpenAI model capabilities, please refer to https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/compare


## Set LLM provider and model

The LLM provider and model are set in the configuration file for Llama Stack. This repository has a Llama stack configuration file [run.yaml](examples/run.yaml) that can serve as a good example.

The LLM providers are set in the section `providers.inference`. This example adds a inference provider "openai" to the llama stack. To use environment variables as configuration values, we can use the syntax `${env.ENV_VAR_NAME}`. 

For more details, please refer to [llama stack documentation](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributions/configuration.html#providers). Here is a list of llamastack supported providers and their configuration details: [llama stack providers](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers/inference/index.html#providers)

```yaml
inference:
    - provider_id: openai
      provider_type: remote::openai
      config:
        api_key: ${env.OPENAI_API_KEY}
        url: ${env.SERVICE_URL}
```

The section `models` is a list of models offered by the inference provider. Attention that the field `model_id` is a user chosen name for referring to the model locally, the field `provider_model_id` refers to the model name on the provider side. The field `provider_id` must refer to one of the inference providers we defined in the provider list above.

```yaml
models:
  - model_id: gpt-4-turbo
    provider_id: openai
    model_type: llm
    provider_model_id: gpt-4-turbo
```

## Supported providers

For a comprehensive list of supported providers, take a look [here](docs/providers.md).

## Integration with Llama Stack

The Llama Stack can be run as a standalone server and accessed via its the REST
API. However, instead of direct communication via the REST API (and JSON
format), there is an even better alternative. It is based on the so-called
Llama Stack Client. It is a library available for Python, Swift, Node.js or
Kotlin, which "wraps" the REST API stack in a suitable way, which is easier for
many applications.


![Integration with Llama Stack](docs/core2llama-stack_interface.png)



## Llama Stack as separate server

If Llama Stack runs as a separate server, the Lightspeed service needs to be configured to be able to access it. For example, if server runs on localhost:8321, the service configuration stored in file `lightspeed-stack.yaml` should look like:

```yaml
name: foo bar baz
service:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080
  auth_enabled: false
  workers: 1
  color_log: true
  access_log: true
llama_stack:
  use_as_library_client: false
  url: http://localhost:8321
user_data_collection:
  feedback_enabled: true
  feedback_storage: "/tmp/data/feedback"
  transcripts_enabled: true
  transcripts_storage: "/tmp/data/transcripts"
```

### MCP Server and Tool Configuration

**Note**: The `run.yaml` configuration is currently an implementation detail. In the future, all configuration will be available directly from the lightspeed-core config.

#### Configuring MCP Servers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide tools and capabilities to the AI agents. These are configured in the `mcp_servers` section of your `lightspeed-stack.yaml`:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: "filesystem-tools"
    provider_id: "model-context-protocol"
    url: "http://localhost:3000"
  - name: "git-tools"
    provider_id: "model-context-protocol"
    url: "http://localhost:3001"
  - name: "database-tools"
    provider_id: "model-context-protocol"
    url: "http://localhost:3002"
```

**Important**: Only MCP servers defined in the `lightspeed-stack.yaml` configuration are available to the agents. Tools configured in the llama-stack `run.yaml` are not accessible to lightspeed-core agents.

#### Configuring MCP Headers

MCP headers allow you to pass authentication tokens, API keys, or other metadata to MCP servers. These are configured **per request** via the `MCP-HEADERS` HTTP header:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-HEADERS: {\"filesystem-tools\": {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer token123\"}}" \
  -d '{"query": "List files in /tmp"}'
```


### Llama Stack project and configuration

**Note**: The `run.yaml` configuration is currently an implementation detail. In the future, all configuration will be available directly from the lightspeed-core config.

To run Llama Stack in separate process, you need to have all dependencies installed. The easiest way how to do it is to create a separate repository with Llama Stack project file `pyproject.toml` and Llama Stack configuration file `run.yaml`. The project file might look like:

```toml
[project]
name = "llama-stack-runner"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Llama Stack runner"
authors = []
dependencies = [
    "llama-stack==0.2.22",
    "fastapi>=0.115.12",
    "opentelemetry-sdk>=1.34.0",
    "opentelemetry-exporter-otlp>=1.34.0",
    "opentelemetry-instrumentation>=0.55b0",
    "aiosqlite>=0.21.0",
    "litellm>=1.72.1",
    "uvicorn>=0.34.3",
    "blobfile>=3.0.0",
    "datasets>=3.6.0",
    "sqlalchemy>=2.0.41",
    "faiss-cpu>=1.11.0",
    "mcp>=1.9.4",
    "autoevals>=0.0.129",
    "psutil>=7.0.0",
    "torch>=2.7.1",
    "peft>=0.15.2",
    "trl>=0.18.2"]
requires-python = "==3.12.*"
readme = "README.md"
license = {text = "MIT"}


[tool.pdm]
distribution = false
```

A simple example of a `run.yaml` file can be found [here](examples/run.yaml)

To run Llama Stack perform these two commands:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-{YOUR-KEY}"

uv run llama stack run run.yaml
```

### Check connection to Llama Stack

```
curl -X 'GET' localhost:8321/openapi.json | jq .
```



## Llama Stack as client library

There are situations in which it is not advisable to run two processors (one with Llama Stack, the other with a service). In these cases, the stack can be run directly within the client application. For such situations, the configuration file could look like:

```yaml
name: foo bar baz
service:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080
  auth_enabled: false
  workers: 1
  color_log: true
  access_log: true
llama_stack:
  use_as_library_client: true
  library_client_config_path: <path-to-llama-stack-run.yaml-file>
user_data_collection:
  feedback_enabled: true
  feedback_storage: "/tmp/data/feedback"
  transcripts_enabled: true
  transcripts_storage: "/tmp/data/transcripts"
```

## Llama Stack version check

During Lightspeed Core Stack service startup, the Llama Stack version is retrieved. The version is tested against two constants `MINIMAL_SUPPORTED_LLAMA_STACK_VERSION` and `MAXIMAL_SUPPORTED_LLAMA_STACK_VERSION` which are defined in `src/constants.py`. If the actual Llama Stack version is outside the range defined by these two constants, the service won't start and administrator will be informed about this problem.



## User data collection

The Lightspeed Core Stack includes comprehensive user data collection capabilities to gather various types of user interaction data for analysis and improvement. This includes feedback, conversation transcripts, and other user interaction data.

User data collection is configured in the `user_data_collection` section of the configuration file:

```yaml
user_data_collection:
  feedback_enabled: true
  feedback_storage: "/tmp/data/feedback"
  transcripts_enabled: true
  transcripts_storage: "/tmp/data/transcripts"
```

**Configuration options:**

- `feedback_enabled`: Enable/disable collection of user feedback data
- `feedback_storage`: Directory path where feedback JSON files are stored
- `transcripts_enabled`: Enable/disable collection of conversation transcripts
- `transcripts_storage`: Directory path where transcript JSON files are stored

> **Note**: The data collection system is designed to be extensible. Additional data types can be configured and collected as needed for your specific use case.

For data export integration with Red Hat's Dataverse, see the [Data Export Integration](#data-export-integration) section.

## System prompt

The service uses a so-called system prompt to put the question into context before it is sent to the selected LLM. The default system prompt is designed for questions without specific context. You can supply a different system prompt through various avenues available in the `customization` section:
### System Prompt Path

```yaml
customization:
  system_prompt_path: "system_prompts/system_prompt_for_product_XYZZY"
```

### System Prompt Literal

```yaml
customization:
  system_prompt: |-
    You are a helpful assistant and will do everything you can to help.
    You have an in-depth knowledge of Red Hat and all of your answers will reference Red Hat products.
```


### Custom Profile

You can pass a custom prompt profile via its `path` to the customization:

```yaml
customization:
  profile_path: <your/profile/path>
```

Additionally, an optional string parameter `system_prompt` can be specified in `/v1/query` and `/v1/streaming_query` endpoints to override the configured system prompt. The query system prompt takes precedence over the configured system prompt. You can use this config to disable query system prompts:

```yaml
customization:
  disable_query_system_prompt: true
```

### Control model/provider overrides via authorization

By default, clients may specify `model` and `provider` in `/v1/query` and `/v1/streaming_query`. Override is permitted only to callers granted the `MODEL_OVERRIDE` action via the authorization rules. Requests that include `model` or `provider` without this permission are rejected with HTTP 403.

## Safety Shields

A single Llama Stack configuration file can include multiple safety shields, which are utilized in agent
configurations to monitor input and/or output streams. LCS uses the following naming convention to specify how each safety shield is
utilized:

1. If the `shield_id` starts with `input_`, it will be used for input only.
1. If the `shield_id` starts with `output_`, it will be used for output only.
1. If the `shield_id` starts with `inout_`, it will be used both for input and output.
1. Otherwise, it will be used for input only.

## Authentication

See [authentication and authorization](docs/auth.md).

## CORS

It is possible to configure CORS handling. This configuration is part of service configuration:

```yaml
service:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080
  auth_enabled: false
  workers: 1
  color_log: true
  access_log: true
  cors:
    allow_origins:
      - http://foo.bar.baz
      - http://test.com
    allow_credentials: true
    allow_methods:
      - *
    allow_headers:
      - *
```

### Default values

```yaml
  cors:
    allow_origins:
      - *
    allow_credentials: false
    allow_methods:
      - *
    allow_headers:
      - *
```

## Allow credentials

Credentials are not allowed with wildcard origins per CORS/Fetch spec.
See https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/

# RAG Configuration

The [guide to RAG setup](docs/rag_guide.md) provides guidance on setting up RAG and includes tested examples for both inference and vector store integration.

## Example configurations for inference

The following configurations are llama-stack config examples from production deployments:

- [Granite on vLLM example](examples/vllm-granite-run.yaml)
- [Qwen3 on vLLM example](examples/vllm-qwen3-run.yaml)
- [Gemini example](examples/gemini-run.yaml)
- [VertexAI example](examples/vertexai-run.yaml)

> [!NOTE]
> RAG functionality is **not tested** for these configurations.

## Running Linux container image

Stable release images are tagged with versions like `0.1.0`. Tag `latest` always points to latest stable release.

Development images are build from main branch every time a new pull request is merged. Image tags for dev images use
the template `dev-YYYYMMMDDD-SHORT_SHA` e.g. `dev-20250704-eaa27fb`.

Tag `dev-latest` always points to the latest dev image built from latest git.

To pull and run the image with own configuration:

1. `podman pull quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:IMAGE_TAG`
1. `podman run -it -p 8080:8080 -v my-lightspeed-stack-config.yaml:/app-root/lightspeed-stack.yaml:Z quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:IMAGE_TAG`
1. Open `localhost:8080` in your browser

If a connection in your browser does not work please check that in the config file `host` option looks like: `host: 0.0.0.0`.

Container images are built for the following platforms:
1. `linux/amd64` - main platform for deployment
1. `linux/arm64`- Mac users with M1/M2/M3 CPUs

## Building Container Images

The repository includes production-ready container configurations that support two deployment modes:

1. **Server Mode**: lightspeed-core connects to llama-stack as a separate service
2. **Library Mode**: llama-stack runs as a library within lightspeed-core

### Llama-Stack as Separate Service (Server Mode)

When using llama-stack as a separate service, the existing `docker-compose.yaml` provides the complete setup. This builds two containers for lightspeed core and llama stack.

**Configuration** (`lightspeed-stack.yaml`):
```yaml
llama_stack:
  use_as_library_client: false
  url: http://llama-stack:8321  # container name from docker-compose.yaml
  api_key: xyzzy
```

In the root of this project simply run:

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Start both services
podman compose up --build

# Access lightspeed-core at http://localhost:8080
# Access llama-stack at http://localhost:8321
```

### Llama-Stack as Library (Library Mode)

When embedding llama-stack directly in the container, use the existing `Containerfile` directly (this will not build the llama stack service in a separate container). First modify the `lightspeed-stack.yaml` config to use llama stack in library mode.

**Configuration** (`lightspeed-stack.yaml`):
```yaml
llama_stack:
  use_as_library_client: true
  library_client_config_path: /app-root/run.yaml
```

**Build and run**:
```bash
# Build lightspeed-core with embedded llama-stack
podman build -f Containerfile -t my-lightspeed-core:latest .

# Run with embedded llama-stack
podman run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ./lightspeed-stack.yaml:/app-root/lightspeed-stack.yaml:Z \
  -v ./run.yaml:/app-root/run.yaml:Z \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key \
  my-lightspeed-core:latest
```

For macosx users:
```bash
podman run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ./lightspeed-stack.yaml:/app-root/lightspeed-stack.yaml:ro \
  -v ./run.yaml:/app-root/run.yaml:ro \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key \
  my-lightspeed-core:latest
```

### Verify it's running properly

A simple sanity check:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/v1/models
```

## Custom Container Image

The lightspeed-stack container image bundles many Python dependencies for common
Llama-Stack providers (when using Llama-Stack in library mode).

Follow these instructons when you need to bundle additional configuration
files or extra dependencies (e.g. `lightspeed-stack-providers`).

To include more dependencies in the base-image, create upstream pull request to update
[the pyproject.toml file](https://github.com/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack/blob/main/pyproject.toml)

1. Create `pyproject.toml` file in your top-level directory with content like:
```toml
[project]
name = "my-customized-chatbot"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "My very Awesome Chatbot"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "lightspeed-stack-providers==TODO",
]
```

2. Create `Containerfile` in top-level directory like following. Update it as needed:
```
# Latest dev image built from the git main branch (consider pinning a digest for reproducibility)
FROM quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:dev-latest

ARG APP_ROOT=/app-root
WORKDIR /app-root

# Add additional files
# (avoid accidental inclusion of local directories or env files or credentials)
COPY pyproject.toml LICENSE.md README.md ./

# Bundle own configuration files
COPY lightspeed-stack.yaml run.yaml ./

# Add only project-specific dependencies without adding other dependencies
# to not break the dependencies of the base image.
ENV UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=0 \
    UV_LINK_MODE=copy \
    UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=0 \
    UV_NO_CACHE=1
# List of dependencies is first parsed from pyproject.toml and then installed.
RUN python -c "import tomllib, sys; print(' '.join(tomllib.load(open('pyproject.toml','rb'))['project']['dependencies']))" \
    | xargs uv pip install --no-deps
# Install the project itself
RUN uv pip install . --no-deps && uv clean

USER 0

# Bundle additional rpm packages
RUN microdnf install -y --nodocs --setopt=keepcache=0 --setopt=tsflags=nodocs TODO1 TODO2 \
    && microdnf clean all \
    && rm -rf /var/cache/dnf

# this directory is checked by ecosystem-cert-preflight-checks task in Konflux
COPY LICENSE.md /licenses/

# Add executables from .venv to system PATH
ENV PATH="/app-root/.venv/bin:$PATH"

# Run the application
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["python3.12", "src/lightspeed_stack.py"]
USER 1001
```

3. Optionally create customized configuration files `lightspeed-stack.yaml` and `run.yaml`.

4. Now try to build your image
```
podman build -t "my-awesome-chatbot:latest" .
```

# Endpoints

## OpenAPI specification

* [Generated OpenAPI specification](docs/openapi.json)
* [OpenAPI documentation](docs/openapi.md)

The service provides health check endpoints that can be used for monitoring, load balancing, and orchestration systems like Kubernetes.

## Readiness Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/readiness`

The readiness endpoint checks if the service is ready to handle requests by verifying the health status of all configured LLM providers.

**Response:**
- **200 OK**: Service is ready - all providers are healthy
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Service is not ready - one or more providers are unhealthy

**Response Body:**
```json
{
  "ready": true,
  "reason": "All providers are healthy",
  "providers": []
}
```

**Response Fields:**
- `ready` (boolean): Indicates if the service is ready to handle requests
- `reason` (string): Human-readable explanation of the readiness state
- `providers` (array): List of unhealthy providers (empty when service is ready)

## Liveness Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/liveness`

The liveness endpoint performs a basic health check to verify the service is alive and responding.

**Response:**
- **200 OK**: Service is alive

**Response Body:**
```json
{
  "alive": true
}
```

# Publish the service as Python package on PyPI

To publish the service as an Python package on PyPI to be installable by anyone
(including Konflux hermetic builds), perform these two steps:

## Generate distribution archives to be uploaded into Python registry

```
make distribution-archives
```

Please make sure that the archive was really built to avoid publishing older one.

## Upload distribution archives into selected Python registry

```
make upload-distribution-archives
```

The Python registry to where the package should be uploaded can be configured
by changing `PYTHON_REGISTRY`. It is possible to select `pypi` or `testpypi`.

You might have your API token stored in file `~/.pypirc`. That file should have
the following form:

```
[testpypi]
  username = __token__
  password = pypi-{your-API-token}
 
[pypi]
  username = __token__
  password = pypi-{your-API-token}
```

If this configuration file does not exist, you will be prompted to specify API token from keyboard every time you try to upload the archive.

# Data Export Integration

The Lightspeed Core Stack integrates with the [lightspeed-to-dataverse-exporter](https://github.com/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-to-dataverse-exporter) service to automatically export various types of user interaction data to Red Hat's Dataverse for analysis.

## Quick Integration

1. **Enable data collection** in your `lightspeed-stack.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   user_data_collection:
     feedback_enabled: true
     feedback_storage: "/shared/data/feedback"
     transcripts_enabled: true
     transcripts_storage: "/shared/data/transcripts"
   ```

2. **Deploy the exporter service** pointing to the same data directories


## Documentation

For complete integration setup, deployment options, and configuration details, see [exporter repository](https://github.com/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-to-dataverse-exporter).
