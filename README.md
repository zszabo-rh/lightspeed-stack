## Running Linux container image

Container image is built every time a new pull request is merged to main branch. Currently there are tags `latest` and `main` pointing to the latest image.

To pull and run the image with own configuration:

1. `podman pull quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:latest`
1. `podman run -it -p 8080:8080 -v my-lightspeed-stack-config.yaml:/app-root/lightspeed-stack.yaml:Z quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:latest`
1. Open `localhost:8080` in your browser

If a connection in your browser does not work please check that in the config file `host` option looks like: `host: 0.0.0.0`.

# Endpoints

The service provides health check endpoints that can be used for monitoring, load balancing, and orchestration systems like Kubernetes.

## Readiness Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/readiness`

The readiness endpoint checks if the service is ready to handle requests by verifying the health status of all configured LLM providers.

**Response:**
- **200 OK**: Service is ready - all providers are healthy
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Service is not ready - one or more providers are unhealthy

**Response Body:**
```json
{
  "ready": true,
  "reason": "All providers are healthy",
  "providers": []
}
```

**Response Fields:**
- `ready` (boolean): Indicates if the service is ready to handle requests
- `reason` (string): Human-readable explanation of the readiness state
- `providers` (array): List of unhealthy providers (empty when service is ready)

## Liveness Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/liveness`

The liveness endpoint performs a basic health check to verify the service is alive and responding.

**Response:**
- **200 OK**: Service is alive

**Response Body:**
```json
{
  "alive": true
}
```
